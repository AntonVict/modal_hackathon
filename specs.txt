AI-agent based game utilizing LangChain

The setting of the game should be very open and free in what the player can do. 


We should have some predefined settings on how the game should start.

The game settings should be like:
Fantasy world
Space world, you are on a spaceship
Pirate(???) world, you are on a ship
Regular world
you are attending the modal hackathon in stockholm, hosted by some venture capital firms and the cloud computing company 


We should have a character creation system that allows the player to create a character that will be used in the game. 
There should be a series of pre-defined fields which the user fills in (height, looks, strength, intelligence, etc.) (maybe we have a limited amount of points to allocated)


Now when the game is running, the story-telling AI-agent should give some introduction and then wait for the player to make a move.
The AI-agent should give the user clear background of whats going on and a series of choices on which the user can make a decision.
There should be like 3 available choices, and one free-text option.

Now the AI-agent should parse this choice and run the corresponding pre-defined-function. 
There should be thorough game-state function handling in place. So all the things one could ask for should be handled by the game-state function.
Think inventory management, current location (maybe have a location system where we have region and city, so that we can be in city:stockholm and go to the docks or train station and such)
, npcs to talk to, etc.
